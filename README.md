# DSA-Playground
ðŸŽ® An interactive web playground for visualizing fundamental data structures and algorithms, including graphs, sorting, stacks, and queues. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

Hey there !!
I wanted to share a personal project I recently completed, the DSA Playground. It's a web application I built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to visualize complex data structures and algorithms.
The tool features an interactive graph builder for pathfinding/MST algorithms, a real-time sorting visualizer, and a stack/queue simulator. I focused on creating an intuitive, hands-on learning experience.
You can try the live demo here: https://dsaplay.netlify.app/
I'm proud of how it turned out and it was a great experience in managing complex state and implementing algorithmic logic. I hope you'll take a moment to check it out.
